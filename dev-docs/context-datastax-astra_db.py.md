Summary:
This code file, named 'astra_db.py', contains helper functions for interacting with an Astra database using the astrapy library. It includes functions to create and retrieve collections in the database, with a focus on vector-based operations using Nvidia's NV-Embed-QA embedding model.

Methods:

1. create_collection(collection_name, embedding_and_chunk_size)
   Creates a new collection in the Astra database or retrieves an existing one.

   Example:
   ```python
   collection = create_collection("my_collection", 768)
   ```

2. get_collection(collection_name)
   Retrieves an existing collection from the Astra database.

   Example:
   ```python
   collection = get_collection("my_collection")
   ```

Note: The code also includes initialization of the Astra database client using environment variables for API keys and endpoints.
