Summary:
This Python script, named 'load_data.py', is designed to load and process Zoom user data from JSON files, chunk the data, and store it in a DataStax Astra DB collection. It utilizes various libraries for data handling, text processing, and database operations.

Main code object: main() function

Methods:

1. dict_to_string(d)
   Converts a dictionary to a string representation.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   data = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
   result = dict_to_string(data)
   print(result)  # Output: "name: John, age: 30"
   ```

2. load_user_from_json(json_file)
   Loads JSON data from a file and maps it to a User object.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   user = load_user_from_json('user_data.json')
   print(user.get_firstname())
   ```

The main() function contains the core logic:

- Initializes the Astra DB collection
- Iterates through JSON files in the data directory
- Processes user data and recordings
- Chunks the recording summaries
- Inserts the chunked data into the Astra DB collection

Example usage:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: The main() function doesn't have separate methods, but it includes several inline operations and data processing steps.
