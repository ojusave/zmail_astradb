Summary:
This code implements a Zoom AI Bot that processes user input through a flow defined in a JSON file. It uses various components like ChatInput, AstraDB, and OpenAI models to generate responses. The bot can be run interactively or with command-line arguments.

Methods:

1. get_response(user_input)
   Description: Runs the flow from a JSON file with the given user input and returns the result.
   Example:
   ```python
   user_input = "What are Zoom's features?"
   response = get_response(user_input)
   print(response)
   ```

2. main()
   Description: Main function to run the bot interactively or process a single query from command-line arguments.
   Example:
   ```python
   # Run interactively
   main()

   # Run with command-line argument
   # python zoom_ai_bot.py "What are Zoom's features?"
   ```

Note: There are no public methods in a class structure, as the code is organized with standalone functions.
